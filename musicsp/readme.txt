1. Install Hercules.  I used the spinhawk version from https://github.com/Open3270/spinhawk


2. Unzip the .VOL file ane Run Hercules using the musicxd_for_hercules.cng configuration file

./unzip_volume
hercules -f musicxd_for_hercules.cng

3. Initialise the mainframe.  Follow this carefully, it's a little odd

[from command line:]  telnet localhost 3270
[from hercules prompt:] ipl 201
[from telnet command line:]  <press enter>

** Leave everything open.  You can ignore the errors if you're just testing, for more information read the full readme.txt

4. Connect to the TN3270 session by running your favourite terminal emulator and connecting to port 3270

5. Login using userid : $000 and password 'music'

6. Use the MUSIC/SP system

7. To quit, press F3 until you leave the menu system and type OFF <enter> to quit the 3270 session. Then type 'quit' on the Hercules window
